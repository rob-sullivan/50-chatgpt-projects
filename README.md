# 50-chatgpt-projects
the code for 50 amazing ChatGPT projects for developers

## Environment Setup
1. Created a repo on [github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) then in [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) I cloned it to my laptop
2. With [python 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) installed I setup a python virtual environment with: 
    >```python -m venv venv_chatgpt```
3. Added venv_chatgpt to .gitignore and pushed changes to github
4. Activated python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
    >```.\venv_chatgpt\Scripts\activate```

## 1. Chatbot

## 3. Code Bug Fixer

## 2. Quiz Generator

## 3. Email Reply Generator
In this project I automatically generate original replies to specific emails by integrating GPT-4 with Outlook API. We use Python 3.7, OpenAI API key, windows and Microsoft Office 365 Outlook for this project.

* Installed Microsoft Outlook on my computer and setup an email account.
* Installed the following libraries in a vs code terminal (ensuring my venv is active!)
>```pip install openai```

>```pip install pywin32```
* Created a file called config.py and save the following into it:
> ```API_KEY = "<YOUR_CHATGPT_API_KEY>"```
* Created a new file called app.py and place the following into it:
```python
import openai
import win32com.client
import tkinter as tk
import config

openai.api_key = config.API_KEY
```
* Launched Outlook and ensured I was signed in, if I saw the outlook window which contained emails, etc, then I should be able to make API calls. I had issues where I was logged in under an old account. I kept getting error messages. Had to ensure I was completely signed out first then signed in with a student email. You can even create a new one to test with.
* Added the following to app.py:
```python
def last_five_emails():
    """Gets the last 5 email subjects from your Outlook and displays them."""

    # I create an object that gives us access to outlook
    outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application").GetNamespace("MAPI")
    #I access emails in the inbox by getting the folder at index 6
    inbox = outlook.GetDefaultFolder(6)
    # Emails are items so I store them in messages
    messages = inbox.Items
    # I get the last subject line (aka the most recent) for each email chain
    emails = [messages.GetLast().Subject]
    # I set to 5 to get the last 5 emails
    email_number = 5
    for i in range(email_number):
        # There are other methods in win32com. 
        # I chose GetPrevious to get the email that came before the most recent email in the chain
        emails.append(messages.GetPrevious().Subject)
    return emails #I return email subjects from this method
```
* Now that I can access the previous 5 emails I then build the UI for the email reply generator. I make use of builtin python UI libary called Tkinter and add the following to app.py:
```python
#I access tkiniter's libary to create a base UI window
root = tk.Tk()
# I set the title and size of that window
root.title("Email Reply Generator")
root.geometry("300x300")

# I call the method we created earlier to get the most recent 5 emails 
# and save the subject lines
email_subjects = last_five_emails()
selected_subject = tk.StringVar()

# I add the subject lines into a dropdown menu button
dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(root, selected_subject, *email_subjects)
dropdown.pack()

# I label the button
label = tk.Label(root, text="Previous emails")
label.pack()

# I call the main tkinter UI to display it for the user
root.mainloop()

```

## 4. Presentation Generator
In this project I automate PowerPoint presentation development by combining DALL-E art with ChatGPTâ€™s human-like text to create presentation slides.

* Installed Microsoft Powerpoint on my computer and setup an email account.
* Installed the following libraries in a vs code terminal (ensuring my venv is active!)
>```pip install python-pptx```

>```pip install openai```

>```pip install requests```
* Created a file called config.py and save the following into it:
> ```API_KEY = "<YOUR_CHATGPT_API_KEY>"```
* Created a new file called app.py and place the following into it:
```python
import collections.abc
import config
assert collections
import tkinter as tk
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt
import openai
from io import BytesIO
import requests

openai.api_key = config.API_KEY
```
* Added the following to app.py to create the GUI to allow users to generate powerpoint slides.
```python
#I first create the gui window for the user
app = tk.Tk()
app.title("Crate PPT Slides")
app.geometry("800x600")

# Create text field
text_field = tk.Text(app)
text_field.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
text_field.configure(wrap="word", font=("Arial", 12))
text_field.focus_set()

# Create the button to create slides
create_button = tk.Button(app, text="Create Slides", command=get_slides)
create_button.pack()
app.mainloop()
```

* Added the following to app.py above where I defined the Tkinter GUI. This allowed me to build functionality for creating the presentation and slides.
```python
def get_slides():
    # I get content from the text field starting from the first character to the last character, except the new line character.
    text = text_field.get("1.0", "end-1c")

    # I split text into paragraphs
    paragraphs = text.split("\n\n")

    # I initalise an empty powerpoint presentation
    prs = Presentation()
    width = Pt(1920)
    height = Pt(1080)
    prs.slide_width = width
    prs.slide_height = height
    # I loop through each text field paragraph and add them to the slides
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        slide_generator(paragraph, prs)
    # Save with file name
    prs.save("chatgpt_presentation.pptx")
```
* Added the following to app.py above where I defined the get_slides(). This allowed me to build functionality for passing ChatGPT output to Dalle prompts.
```python
def slide_generator(text, prs):
    prompt = f"Summarize the following text to a DALL-E image generation prompt: \n {text}"

    model_engine = "gpt-4"
    dlp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model_engine,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "I will ask you a question"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}
        ],
        max_tokens=250,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.8
    )
    
    dalle_prompt = dlp["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    dalle_prompt = dlp.choices[0].text
    response = openai.Image.create(
        prompt=dalle_prompt + " Style: digital art",
        n=1,
        size="1024x1024")
    image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
```
* Now I create slide headers and bullet points using Dall-E generated images and ChatGPT generated text.
```python

```
