Jellyfish, also known as medusas or sea jellies, are fascinating creatures that inhabit the worldâ€™s oceans.
They belong to the phylum Cnidaria and are characterized by their gelatinous bodies and tentacles.

Jellyfish come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from small and transparent to
large and vibrant. They have a unique life cycle, starting as a polyp attached to the ocean floor before
transforming into a free-swimming medusa.

One of the most intriguing aspects of jellyfish is their ability to sting. They possess specialized cells called
cnidocytes, which contain nematocysts that deliver venomous toxins. These stinging cells allow jellyfish to
capture prey and defend themselves from potential predators. While most jellyfish stings are harmless to
humans, some species can cause painful or even dangerous reactions. It is advisable to exercise caution
when swimming in waters known to have jellyfish populations.

Jellyfish play important roles in marine ecosystems. They are opportunistic feeders, consuming small
planktonic organisms, fish eggs, and even other jellyfish. As predators, they help maintain a balance in the
marine food web. Additionally, jellyfish have a unique ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
